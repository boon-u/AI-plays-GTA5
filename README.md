I ain't got much to talk about this, most of the code is his and I changed them according to my specifications.
I used this as a toy problem to get started with DNN.

To use it, just run the test_model.py (link to a trained model : https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Z0CiZpWzLaEwCIfYY6sqKGBWAvpyD1l ), and don't forget to change the dimensions according to your window size.
After cleaning data, the valid data samples are around 22k and the accuracy of the model is 67% (not so bad !!)
