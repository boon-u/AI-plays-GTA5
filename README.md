I have minimal comments to add here, as much of the foundational code was provided, with modifications made to meet specific requirements. This served as an introductory project for experimenting with Deep Neural Networks (DNN).

To run, simply execute test_model.py (trained model available here). Ensure window dimensions are adjusted as necessary. Following data cleanup, the model achieved approximately 22,000 valid samples and a 67% accuracy rate.
